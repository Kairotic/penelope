Beginnings

- In the year 2000, few believed in the creativity of programming
- Computer artists hid their screens and keyboards
- Computer music was gripped by sound diffusion and seamless sensory
  interfaces

Personal view of influences

Live coding
- Making creativity of programming self-evident
- Programming language as user interface
- Community

Projection
- Distraction / contention of cognitive resources
- Looks like a powerpoint presentation
- Audience stand in a row, zombified
-- We don't have zoomed-in cameras projecting guitarist's finger technique
-- answer - smaller projection, or more projections?

From scratch live coding <<--?--?--?-->> Code jockying

Learning in flow
- Ideal live coding performance - learning new language from scratch

Anti-commercialism
- From scratch live coding, start with nothing + end with nothing
- Red plenty - record + share everything
-- manipulate time
-- cyclic revision control
